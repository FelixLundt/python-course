### Version for poster presentation - for all programming courses

There is a end-of-semester poster session for all programming courses. It is going to take place on **Feb 14, 14:00-15:30 (in rooms H3007, H3006)**.
For efficiency reasons, we will make the preparation and presentation of the poster the final presentation assignment for this course.
However, you will not be graded during the big poster session. Instead, you will have a 5-minute presentation in the tutorial on **Feb 12**.

In brief:

**Format:** Poster presentation 

**Preparation:** 
Workshop on poster presentations in tutorial next week (Feb 5)
    - Brief 'How to'-guide on how to make a poster
    - Support to draft the poster during the tutorial

**Tutorial on Feb 12:** 5-minute poster presentations by each group (more on that on Feb 5)

**Grading:** Based on poster and in-tutorial presentation, 20% of overall score. More details on Feb 5.



### Version for talk - only course participants

**Date:** Monday, Feb 13 during the tutorial time. Schedule below.

**Duration:** 15 Minutes.

| Time | Group |
|---|---|
| 9:00 | Group A |
| 9:20 | Group B |
....

**Content:** 
The general purpose of the final presentation is to present the agent(s) you developed in the second phase of the course to the other students. The two main questions your presentation should address are:

- How does your agent work?
- How well does your agent work?

Roughly speaking, your presentation should therefore consist of two parts:

- Description of the new agent (background if necessary, implementation & design)
- Evaluation of the new agent (Could be along the lines of questions such as: What are the strengths and weaknesses of your agent and how do those show in games? How does your agent perform against your minimax agent? Think about ways to quantify the performance. What could be done to improve the agent even further?)

The 'How' and 'How well' parts are equally important, so they should be roughly equally long.

**Grading:**
I’m aware of the craziness at the end of the semester. You don’t need to aim for a perfectly polished presentation, getting the basics right is more important to me. I do expect a few slides and that you stick to the time limit (see below) though. The presentation is worth 20/100 total points and you'll receive individual scores. 

Grading will be based on the following criteria
- Structure (choice & order of content, how well do specific parts relate to the presentation as a whole; transitions between slides are often a tell-tale indicator)
- Clarity, conciseness, coherence of the presentation (this basically comes down to striking a balance between keeping it simple and accessible vs. specific, detailed info; or, between being too vague and getting lost in details)
- Visuals (not too much text, structured text, good images/figures, visuals should support content and not distract)
- Time limit (± 1 min) & roughly equal share of presentation time for each team member.
