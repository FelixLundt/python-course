### Organizational matters

- Due date is Sunday, February 16 (so submissions until including 11:59pm are okay).

- This is a group submission, so only one student needs to submit. 

- Please submit your zipped project directory

    - agent package(s)
    - test package
    - `main.py` script to play against your agent
    - `requirements.txt` file for dependencies
    - `README.md` file describing the agent briefly
    - any other relevant material (sanity checks, test runs on different data sets, benchmarking results, etc.)


### Grading

Below, I'll first list what the criteria for the scores are, how many points each criterion is worth, and then list a few things I pay special attention to. Note that the second submission is worth 40 points in total.


| Criterion | Weight | Comment |
|---|---|---|

| Code quality | 50% | Readability & Clarity; Attributes of good code. |
| Testing | 15% | Thorough testing for core functionality, testing of more advanced features as bonus (*).|
| Documentation | 15% | Docstrings for classes & functions, good naming, type hints. |
| Project status | 20% | Has reasonable progress been made/have goals been achieved? |


(*) Examples: Core MCTS implementation should be tested, testing of network training is hard and not expected.
