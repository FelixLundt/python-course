### General idea

In the proposal presentations, every group is supposed to explain their planned project to the rest of the course. This includes explaining the core idea and methods as well as preparing a detailed plan of the actual execution of the project.

The purpose of the proposal presentations is at least threefold: 

- First, and most importantly, they force you to do serious research about possible avenues for your project and to think critically about how they could be implemented. Often, the importance of taking this step is underrated, and hopefully by the end of the semester you agree that having a specific plan at the outset can have large benefits.
- Second, it's a good way for me to get an overview of what all the groups are planning. This way, I can effectively supervise from a very early stage, because I know right away if groups are very (read: overly) ambitions, a bit confused, not yet working well together, etc.
- Third, together with the final presentations this course is a good opportunity for you to improve your skills in that regard. They are relatively closely spaced, so it's easy for all of you and me to keep track of feedback and assess progress. I want to stress that it's my explicit intention to help you with improving. I'll do my best to give you constructive feedback, and in the proposal presentations specifically there'll be enough room for error with regard to the grades. As for the entire course, my personal emphasis is not on grades, points and credits, but on giving you useful input and feedback. Maybe two minor additions are in order:
  - Please don't abuse this. You'll get the most out of my feedback if you try to give as good a presentation you can.
  - This is not a presentation workshop, so the basis for your improvement is my personal opinion. I'm not a certified teacher in that regard, so keep that in mind. I have seen my fair share of (good and, more importantly, bad) presentations and lectures though, so I'm confident my feedback is at least somewhat useful. I'll also try to separate things that I think are objectively good/bad from my more personal preferences in any feedback.


### Instructions

Part of my personal taste (but this should definitely be a general rule as far as I'm concerned) is that I'm a friend of getting the basics right before making things pretty and perfect, especially when it comes to presentations. You'll see that this is reflected in the criteria outlined below. Together with the fact that I'm aware you have other things to do, this leads to the following request: 
Please make sure you have your content straight, focus on giving a clear presentation, and only optimize the optics/transitions/other fancy effects if you still have time after that. I'm really happy about any extra effort any of you put in this course, but I think it's important to make the first step before the second. This might seem obvious, but for presentations it often doesn't seem like something people care about. Don't try to hide behind fancy stuff and obscure weaknesses or insecurity. 


### Details & criteria

Let's get a bit more concrete about details of the proposal presentations:

- Content (not necessarily in order): After the presentation, everybody should know
    - what your idea is and which methods & theory it relies on and
    - specifically how you plan to complete the project
- Max. 10 minutes + 5 minutes for questions/discussion
- Grades are individual (even though more often than not they're very even among groups). Therefore, all group members need to contribute roughly equally.

You should target the other students, not me, in the presentations. Note that 10 minutes might not be enough to explain every detail about the underlying theory, so you'll have to make choices. In general, it's okay to just explain what you're going to use and how different parts interact. If you have time and something is particularly important, you can be more specific about distinct points though. Being specific in your plan is crucial though, this is the part where it usually becomes obvious if people know what they're talking about (see criteria below). 


Grading criteria (roughly equal weight, first two slightly more important):

- **Clarity, conciseness, coherence of the presentation:** This comes down to striking a balance between keeping it simple and accessible vs. specific, detailed info; or, between being too vague and getting lost in details.
- **Specificity of the project plan (implementation & work plan):** Breaking down the project into smaller tasks & subtasks, plan of how much time you want to take for each step, safety nets, milestones, etc. 
- **Structure:** order of content, how well do specific parts relate to the presentation as a whole; transitions between slides are often a tell-tale indicator
- **Visuals:** good images/figures, not too much text, structured text if necessary. Overall, visuals should support content and not distract.
- **Time limits:** Important for fairness and for orientation, it's easy to be specific about everything if you talk for way too long - but that's of course not the point. 
- **Proposal itself (content):** Does the theory/proposal portion make sense, is it sound and is it realistic?
