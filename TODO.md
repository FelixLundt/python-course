- [ ] To round out the course, include a brief 'Get started with Python' lesson going into how to use Python, virtual environments.. (overlap with content in first week)
- [ ] think about structure of this repo. Two choices:
    - Keep structure flat. Most stuff can be moved around, and the flat structure illustrates that
    - Introduce weekly subfolders. Might look more organized, but also less flexible

- [ ] Add something about general course idea.
    - Example: First part is very structured, should enable people to get started easily, learn basics (Python, TDD, git, etc.). Second part is more open-ended, should enable people to work on more advanced stuff and should emulate a real-world project, where you don't always know how things are going to work out, and where it takes deliberate effort to still work on documentation, testing, etc.

- [ ] Add markdown version of the poster workshop slides.
- [ ] Maybe add presentation workshop?
- [ ] Add logging to content? Is important for scaling things
