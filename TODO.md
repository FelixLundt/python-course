- [ ] To round out the course, include a brief 'Get started with Python' lesson going into how to use Python, virtual environments.. (overlap with content in first week)

    - Keep structure flat. Most stuff can be moved around, and the flat structure illustrates that
    - Introduce weekly subfolders. Might look more organized, but also less flexible
