This week is about recapping phase 1 of the course and about providing a glimpse of possible paths for phase 2 (see slides and material below). To reiterate, here is how phase 2 is going to work:
 
##### Topic

In principle, you are free to choose what you are going to work on. A natural continuation would be to build a more sophisticated agent, but I am open to other suggestions. The only hard requirement is that the project should still be written in Python.

##### Groups

The second phase of the course will be carried out in groups of 3 or 4 students. Please take initiative to form groups yourselves. I think it's better if you end up in groups you want to be in, rather than me imposing groups on you. That being said, if you have trouble finding teammates, please let me know. I will have to make sure everybody is in a group of 3 or 4, so I might have to make adjustments to the groups you are setting up. 

##### Timeline

The next important date is **December 4**. During the tutorial on that day, all groups will give a short proposal presentation where they outline their project plan (more details next week). In order to make sure you have enough time to prepare, please use the time **until the next tutorial (Nov 27)** to do some research, figure out what you would like to work on and find people to form a group with. We will assess the group situation in the tutorial and finalize the groups then. 

**Important:** Please do reach out to me once you found people to work with, or if you have trouble doing so!
