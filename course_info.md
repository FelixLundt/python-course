### Important information 

This course is one of the programming courses for Bachelor students of Fakultät IV. For more information about how to register, see: https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/section.php?id=601518

Registration for the exam is done via MOSES (search for 'Programming Project in Python'). The deadline to register/withdraw is November 6!


## Welcome to the Programming Project!

### The course

Students will implement a software agent that plays the (turn-based, perfect information) game Connect 4. To that end, we will cover state-of-the-art search algorithms employed, e.g., in chess engines such as Stockfish and AlphaZero. Another main focus of this course are principles of software development.

The semester will proceed in two main phases (tentative timeline):
- Implementation of a prototype (individually; first 5 weeks)
- Implementation of a more advanced agent (in groups, rest of the semester) 

Tentative outline for the first phase:

| 2         | TDD                        | Code snippets                                           |                                                         |

| 4         | Debugging<br>Documentation |                                                         |                                                         | 
| 5         | Profiling                  |                                                         | Prototype submission                                    | 


At each phase, code should be well tested and well documented. Collaboration within each group should use appropriate software development processes, including issue tracking, milestones, feature development within repository branches, etc.

The main objective of the course is to teach basic concepts of 'software carpentry', e.g.

* Use of a version control system, such as git
* Test-driven development
* Documentation
* Debugging, profiling, and optimization
* (Optional) Issue tracking, and milestones for project planning
* (Optional) Software design and associated artifacts, e.g. activity/class diagrams



### Preparations

Prior to the first tutorial, please make sure that you are ready to start writing and running Python code. I recommend using an IDE that allows to run a debugger and automated tests, as well as having syntax highlighting, autocompletion, formatting etc. (e.g., PyCharm or VS Code). Furthermore, it is useful to create a new virtual environment with Python version 3.12 for this course (e.g., using conda which is included in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)). In case you run into any problems doing so, please don't hesitate to get in touch. 


### Tutorials & Communication

The tutorial will take place in person on Wednesdays from 10:15am to 2pm in room 4.062 of the MAR building. Tutorials will usually have a teaching component, individual supervision and time for discussions. 

We will also use the ISIS course page for announcements and organizational matters, as well as discussions and questions if necessary.


### Dates

Note that these are tentative dates and might still change.

Tentative date for prototype submission: November 17, 24.

Tentative date for proposal presentations (topic tba): Late November, early December 24

Tentative date for final presentations: February 12, 25.

Tentative date for second agent submission: February 8, 25.


### Grades

Grades (pass/fail) will be based on two software implementations (prototype and advanced agent) as well as two presentations:

1. Topic tba (tentatively 1-2 weeks after completing the prototype), example from previous years: A proposal presentation where students summarize their exploratory research and outline their planned software architecture, as well as any technologies or theory they intend to employ. 
2. A final presentation about the advanced agent (most likely last week of the lecture period).

Criteria for grading the submissions and presentations will be announced over the course of the semester. At least 60 out of 100 total points are required to pass (see table below for distribution).

It is highly recommended to pay attention to the project structure and code quality from the beginning. Recall that the single most important lesson of this course is to develop good programming habits!
