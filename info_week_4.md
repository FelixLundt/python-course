This week we cover code documentation and debugging, and we'll go over details of the submission of the prototype.

**Documentation:** Take a look at the slides, as well as the relevant parts on the 'Resources' page. For the purpose of this course, I expect you to write docstrings for all functions and classes, use type hints, and use comments appropriately (i.e., as few as possible) - see slides. 

**Debugging:** See the text page below for more.

**Submission info:** See slides, as well as the 'Prototype' assignment in the 'General' section of the main page.
