The first tutorial is an opportunity for everybody to meet and get to know each other. Specifically, I want to know more about your background and your expectations for the course (beyond the poll). 

The main goal of this week is to get everybody up and running. We'll make sure everybody has their IDE and virtual environments ready and is able to write and run scripts. There will also be time to go over introductory material for Python and numpy (see resources page).

Furthermore, I want to give you a general introduction to the course and give you a more concrete idea about what the first weeks are going to be about.
