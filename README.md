## Directory Structure

The course content is not organized in any substructure, because I want the more widely relevant files to be easily accessible. Check the `course_structure.md` file for a detailed overview of the temporal structure of the course. Typically, each week has the following files:

-   `info_week_*.md`: Provides specific information and agenda for the week.
-   `*.py`: Python script files, including skeletons or examples.
-   `*.md`: Markdown files with additional context, tutorials, or explanations.
-   `slides.pdf`: Presentation slides for the week's lecture (not available in the repository).
-   Other relevant resources like links to external forms or specific assignment details.

Example structure:

```
week-to-week-content/
├── week_1/
│   ├── info_week_1.md
│   ├── prior_experience_poll  (external Google form link, likely in info_week_1.md)
│   └── slides.pdf
├── week_2/
│   ├── info_week_2.md
│   ├── game_utils_skeleton.py
│   ├── context_first_assignment.md
│   ├── scripts_modules_packages.md
│   ├── tdd_demo.md
│   └── slides.pdf
└── ... (and so on for subsequent weeks)
```
